  - title: Rules N' Guidelines
    body: >-
      1. Use common sense and be courteous. Also, be social! You’re here to hang
      out and meet people, so introduce yourself to others. If you see someone
      struggling, help them out.

      2. We decide the camping spots. We’re trying to keep track of where people
      are to help people find each other. So don’t move or spread into your
      neighbor’s area unless you get permission from both them and us.

      3. Small Country’s “3 pets per campsite” is per their sites, not our cells
      of assignment. You’re responsible for your pets, so keep them under
      control.

      4. Fire safety is a must. No unattended fires! Fires must be in a fire
      ring or pit. If there is not a fire ring or pit, find one! No setting
      random things on fire.

      5. No food? There are stores nearby. It’s OK to barter and share with
      others, but don’t expect/steal provisions. Do not sell food outright.

      6. Drinking (if you’re of age) is fine. Don’t drink to the point of
      belligerent or fall-down drunk. If you reach this point, we’ll ask you to
      go to your tent to sleep it off. Don’t puke on the moon bounce. No alcohol
      is permitted at or on the lake anymore.

      7. Dispose of your trash. We’re not your parents! We don’t want to ask you
      to clean up after yourself.

      8. Stay hydrated! Heatstroke will not be noticed until it is too late.
      CONSTANTLY. DRINK. WATER.

      9. We’re all crammed together pretty tight. Be considerate to others.
      Don’t beg, steal, if your neighbor asks you to keep it down, try to do so,
      etc. Don’t harass others at the campground.

      10. If you brought stuff to sell, don’t be pushy or shady about it. If you
      have more than a small table worth of things to sell, talk to us before
      you do it so we can assess the situation and help you.

      11. No attempting to drown people or items in the lake.

      12. No vandalizing the campground or anyone else’s belongings.

      13. Wear your wristband at all times while in the MAGStock area.

      14. Read and abide by the Small Country Campground rules.

      15. Also... No defecating in the showers, because, dude, really?
