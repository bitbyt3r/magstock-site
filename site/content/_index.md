  - title: Rules N' Guidelines
    body: >-
      1. Use common sense and be courteous. Also, be social! You’re here to hang
      out and meet people, so introduce yourself to others. If you see someone
      struggling, help them out.

      2. We decide the camping spots. We’re trying to keep track of where people
      are to help people find each other. So don’t move or spread into your
      neighbor’s area unless you get permission from both them and us.

      3. Small Country’s “3 pets per campsite” is per their sites, not our cells
      of assignment. You’re responsible for your pets, so keep them under
      control.

      4. Fire safety is a must. No unattended fires! Fires must be in a fire
      ring or pit. If there is not a fire ring or pit, find one! No setting
      random things on fire.

      5. No food? There are stores nearby. It’s OK to barter and share with
      others, but don’t expect/steal provisions. Do not sell food outright.

      6. Drinking (if you’re of age) is fine. Don’t drink to the point of
      belligerent or fall-down drunk. If you reach this point, we’ll ask you to
      go to your tent to sleep it off. Don’t puke on the moon bounce. No alcohol
      is permitted at or on the lake anymore.

      7. Dispose of your trash. We’re not your parents! We don’t want to ask you
      to clean up after yourself.

      8. Stay hydrated! Heatstroke will not be noticed until it is too late.
      CONSTANTLY. DRINK. WATER.

      9. We’re all crammed together pretty tight. Be considerate to others.
      Don’t beg, steal, if your neighbor asks you to keep it down, try to do so,
      etc. Don’t harass others at the campground.

      10. If you brought stuff to sell, don’t be pushy or shady about it. If you
      have more than a small table worth of things to sell, talk to us before
      you do it so we can assess the situation and help you.

      11. No attempting to drown people or items in the lake.

      12. No vandalizing the campground or anyone else’s belongings.

      13. Wear your wristband at all times while in the MAGStock area.

      14. Read and abide by the Small Country Campground rules.

      15. Also... No defecating in the showers, because, dude, really?

      Volunteering for MAGStock is easy! Our events are built on volunteer
      participation, so we encourage every attendee to get involved. However if
      it's your first year at MAGStock we recommend you NOT volunteer so that
      you'll have more time to enjoy all the awesomeness without needing to
      worry about being in a specific place at a particular time.\

      \

      This page will tell you what you need to do if you'd like to join the
      MAGStock team


      Volunteers are required to purchase admission to the event, the only
      volunteer compensation is some items from the support swag items. And of
      course the thanks from your grateful organizers who love it when awesome
      people pitch in to do great things!


      If you have any questions about the above, feel free to contact

      #### Step 1: Begin the registration process


      We'll need to begin collecting your information, so go to the
      [pre-registration](https://magstock7.uber.magfest.org/uber/preregistration/form)
      page where you can begin entering your basic details.


      #### Step 2: Check the "Want to Volunteer?" checkbox


      The checkbox appears about half-way down the page. Once you check this,
      additional options will become available.


      {{< div class="center" >}}

      {{ < /div >}}


      #### Step 3: Select the areas you want to help


      <div class="center">


      ![null](http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4DZ37bLv7w2k44nvz4DQSDEYeRlf56pQVRm8zRV83ub2ip6g4LtTxtOAQNvviNaAiwThqVNvyOm-N3kq1LR28m9i3VvA=s1200)

      MAGStock has just a few departments working together in tight coordination
      to keep everything running smoothly. Check off whichever department
      interests you most!


      * Cat Herding - Helps to show people to their assigned campsites, manage
      vehicle traffic (Including parking areas) and in general gets involved
      with crowd management issues.

      * Food - Works with the staff in charge of food to prepare, serve and
      clean up for each meal.

      * Standby/Misc - General catch all to help with whatever the current needs
      are (If you have attended a MAGFest event before , this is equivalent to
      the staff support position.)

      * Music - All the things involved with the musical performances at
      MAGStock - stage hands, lights, cables, sound. (Holding the tent up when
      it rains).

      * Registration - checking in attendees, showing them where on the map
      their site is, this also includes selling MAGStock Merch and passing out
      pre-paid shirts / supporter gear.

      * Slip 'n Slide - Setting up and running the slip and slide with the
      planning team.


      #### Step 4: Complete and pay for your registration


      <div class="center">


      ![null](http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m-jjBklByVAsLTsoyk77KGMk_G8bGMCxgRkUsSbUFjEBoEtvCI5nn5TRqwEOiEacHlRisrX8k6jElxDdM-eW240aC3A=s1200)


      </div>


      Step 5: You're all confirmed!


      That's all you need to do to register yourself as a volunteer! As the
      event approaches (usually 2 months beforehand), our Staff Operations
      department (STOPS) will send you a Volunteer Checklist where you can
      confirm your attendance, and sign up for shifts in your department.


      If you have any questions about the above, feel free to contact
