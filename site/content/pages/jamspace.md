Do you like to jam out? Do you enjoy funk, jazz, metal, EDM, and other genres, and perhaps combining them with video game music...live? How about rocking alongside your fellow MAGWest attendees and our performing guests, while also enjoying a diverse array of instructional classes, impromptu performances, and music-centric competitions?

Come to the Jamspace, where all this happens from morning into the late night! We’ll provide a set of basic instruments, such as guitars, basses, drums, and keyboards, and you supply the collective raw energy and talent. Feel free to bring your own instrument as well, and we’ll get you mic’d up and plugged in. Of course, for space reasons, please keep your Neil Peart tribute kit and your pipe organ at home.

Unsure about how to jam in a group setting, or want to learn about composition, arranging, and a bit of music theory? We have two scheduled masterclasses with the Super Soul Bros and a rotating crew of volunteers who can help you master the art of musical communication while having a great time together. Visit MAGWest’s Jamspace, and make the stage yours!
