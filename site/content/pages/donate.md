MAGFest is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, so there are several ways you are able to make charitable donations to us--and you can write it off on your taxes!

Donate old games and systems. MAGFest's gameroom is built from donations and yard sales. Make it better by donating games and systems you no longer play, can't believe we're missing, or would like to share with others. Email [contact@magfest.org](mail:contact@magfest.org) for more information, or to donate.
