Use common sense and be courteous. Also, be social! You’re here to hang out and meet people, so introduce yourself to others. If you see someone struggling, help them out.

1. We decide the camping spots. We’re trying to keep track of where people are to help people find each other. So don’t move or spread into your neighbor’s area unless you get permission from both them and us.
2. Pets are welcome but we strictly apply the “no bark – no bite” policy, a leash law and clean up after pet (state law).
3. Quiet hour is 11pm. Please keep noise down after this time.
4. We’re all crammed together pretty tight. Be considerate to others. Don’t beg, steal, if your neighbor asks you to keep it down, try to do so, etc. Don’t harass others at the campground.
5. Fire safety is a must. No unattended fires! Fires must be in a fire ring or pit. If there is not a fire ring or pit, find one! No setting random things on fire.
6. No food? There are stores nearby. It’s OK to barter and share with others, but don’t expect/steal provisions. Do not sell food outright.
7. Drinking (if you’re of age) is fine. Don’t drink to the point of belligerent or fall-down drunk. If you reach this point, we’ll ask you to go to your tent to sleep it off. Don’t puke on the moon bounce. No alcohol is permitted at or on the lake anymore.
8. Dispose of your trash. We’re not your parents! We don’t want to ask you to clean up after yourself.
9. Stay hydrated! Heatstroke will not be noticed until it is too late. CONSTANTLY. DRINK. WATER.
10. If you brought stuff to sell, don’t be pushy or shady about it. If you have more than a small table worth of things to sell, talk to us before you do it so we can assess the situation and help you.
11. No attempting to drown people or items in the lake.
12. No vandalizing the campground or anyone else’s belongings.
13. Wear your wristband at all times.
14. Checkout time is 12:00 PM Sunday -- this is when your gear should be mostly packed and your campsite cleaned up. Feel free to stick a round for longer to help out or get some last minute hangs though!
15. Children under 18 must be at their campsite and under a parent’s supervision after 11pm. 
16. Read and abide by the Small Country Campground Rules (available on-site).
17. And lastly, read and abide the [MAGFest Code of Conduct](http://super.magfest.org/codeofconduct/).
