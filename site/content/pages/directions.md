# By Car

The Hyatt is located right off of the 101 and 237 highways. Driving directions can be found on the Hyatt's website. Parking is complimentary for hotel guests.

# By Amtrak

The ACE and Capitol Corridor Amtrak train lines leave from Stockton and Sacramento respectively and stop at the Amtrak Santa Clara Great America station, 15 minutes walk from the hotel.

# By BART

The Hyatt is most accessible from Fremont Station. From there, transfer to the VTA 180 Express bus (weekdays only) or the VTA 181 Express bus. On the VTA 180, ride to Great Mall Transit Center and change to the light rail bound for Santa Teresa. Change again at the Tasman light rail station to the Mountain View light rail line, before getting off at Great America Station. (Total time, not including transit to Fremont Station, is ~1.5 hours.) For the VTA 181, change at 1st and Mission to the VTA Light Rail Station across the street. Grab the train headed for Mountain View and get off at Great America. (Total time is ~1 hour.)

# By Caltrain

There are two ways to reach the hotel by Caltrain (weekday schedule, weekend schedule). One is to take Caltrain to the Mountain View Station, and then hop on the VTA Light Rail "Winchester" Train to the Old Ironsides station (also known as the "Great America/Levi's Stadium/Santa Clara Convention Center" station). The other is to take Caltrain to Santa Clara Station. Then, hop on the VTA 60 bus for 20 minutes to the Great America and Old Glory stop, before walking 7 minutes to the hotel. The total time for both options is roughly 30 minutes.

# By Air

San Jose International Airport is the closet airport to the Hyatt, located 6 miles away. To get from SJC to the Hyatt, you can take the VTA 902 bus, which will set you back $2.00 one-way for a 20 minute trip with no transfers.

The venue is also accessible from San Francisco International Airport and Oakland International Airport (both about 30 miles away). Unfortunately, the hotel does not provide a complimentary shuttle from any airport. Ask a friend or grab a Lyft! (For those who are truly bold and have time to spare, public transit is an option too [see above], but will require several transfers from SFO or OAK and about 2 hours of your time.)
