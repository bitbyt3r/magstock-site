Volunteering for MAGStock is easy! Our events are built on volunteer participation, so we encourage every attendee to get involved.

Between prepping food or checking in attendees, there's something for everyone! We don't ask a lot -- just signing up for one, 3 hour shifts makes a world of difference to us. Volunteer for enough hours and you'll even [be rewarded!](https://magstock8.uber.magfest.org/uber/static_views/stafferComps.html)

Volunteers are required to purchase admission to the event, but once done, you're off to the races! Make sure to check 'Sign me up!' when registering so we know you're interested. If you have any questions about, feel free to contact <mailto:magstock@magstock.org>.
