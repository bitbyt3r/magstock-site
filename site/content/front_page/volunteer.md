Volunteering for MAGStock is easy! Our events are built on volunteer participation, so we encourage every attendee to get involved. However if it's your first year at MAGStock we recommend you NOT volunteer so that you'll have more time to enjoy all the awesomeness without needing to worry about being in a specific place at a particular time.

This page will tell you what you need to do if you'd like to join the MAGStock team

Volunteers are required to purchase admission to the event, the only volunteer compensation is some items from the support swag items. And of course the thanks from your grateful organizers who love it when awesome people pitch in to do great things!

If you have any questions about the above, feel free to contact <mailto:magstock@magstock.org>.
