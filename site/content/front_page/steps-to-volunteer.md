#### Step 1: Begin the registration process

We'll need to begin collecting your information, so go to the [pre-registration](https://magstock7.uber.magfest.org/uber/preregistration/form) page where you can begin entering your basic details.

#### Step 2: Check the "Want to Volunteer?" checkbox

The checkbox appears about half-way down the page. Once you check this, additional options will become available.

MAGStock has just a few departments working together in tight coordination to keep everything running smoothly. Check off whichever department interests you most!

* Cat Herding - Helps to show people to their assigned campsites, manage vehicle traffic (Including parking areas) and in general gets involved with crowd management issues.
* Food - Works with the staff in charge of food to prepare, serve and clean up for each meal.
* Standby/Misc - General catch all to help with whatever the current needs are (If you have attended a MAGFest event before , this is equivalent to the staff support position.)
* Music - All the things involved with the musical performances at MAGStock - stage hands, lights, cables, sound. (Holding the tent up when it rains).
* Registration - checking in attendees, showing them where on the map their site is, this also includes selling MAGStock Merch and passing out pre-paid shirts / supporter gear.
* Slip 'n Slide - Setting up and running the slip and slide with the planning team.

#### Step 4: Complete and pay for your registration

Step 5: You're all confirmed!

That's all you need to do to register yourself as a volunteer! As the event approaches (usually 2 months beforehand), our Staff Operations department (STOPS) will send you a Volunteer Checklist where you can confirm your attendance, and sign up for shifts in your department.

If you have any questions about the above, feel free to contact <mailto:magstock@magstock.org>.
