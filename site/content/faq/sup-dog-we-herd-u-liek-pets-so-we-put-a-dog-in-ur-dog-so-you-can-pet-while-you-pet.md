Pets are allowed and there is no charge. They must be kept on a leash at all times. The site has aggressive breed restrictions so please call them first. There's a no barking and biting policy and a maximum of 3 pets allowed per campsite. Since we're all going to be crammed together you may want to consider leaving your pet in the care of someone at home.
